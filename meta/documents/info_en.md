# Hood.de

<div class="container-toc"></div>

Since its foundation in 2000, Hood.de has become one of Germany‘s biggest online marketplaces with more than 1.5 million members, more than 4 million offers per day, and more than 3 million visitors per month. Sellers using Hood.de profit from the unrivalled cost-efficient fee structure. No other German marketplace allows for a more cost-efficient sale for the retailer, as no listing fees or basic fees incur. Furthermore, professional sellers can profit from premium services such as the “Hood-Shop” or other specials, including marketing for the seller’s product range offered on Hood.de. Offers can be listed as buy-it-now items in the seller’s own Hood-shop, optionally with negotiating-option, auction, power-auction or as Dutch auction.
